According to Marc Bekoff ((6/07/2012, Minding Animals 2, Utrecht, NL), <strong>Minding Animals</strong> means:
<ol>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Taking care of other animals and providing a life that is safe and peaceful...</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Attributing minds to them: We know they are clever and have deep and rich emotional lives and care very much about what happens to them; we know they are conscious and feel pain; these facts are, or should be, givens when we interact with them; that's why most, if not all of us, are here and care...</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
Unlike the millenary use of “animal” in Spanish, English, French… in central-south native american languages there is not a word that clearly distinguishes the human “species” from the rest of the animals.
