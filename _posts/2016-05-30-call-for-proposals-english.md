What Should Your Abstract Consider? As for the previous three Minding Animals Conferences, MAC4 will be open to no end of papers dedicated to animal studies and animal protection. We would like to stress that Minding Animals International Inc. (MAI) works to further the development of animal studies internationally and to help establish legal and moral protections for all nonhuman animals. As such, Minding Animals Conferences are available for animal academics and activists alike, and provides an avenue for the transdisciplinary field of Animal Studies in all its guises (Human Animal Studies, Anthrozoology, Critical Animal Studies and so on) to be more responsive to the protection of animals. It is recognized that animal protection in this context encapsulates environmentalism, animal liberation, animal rights, wildlife protection, animal welfare and animal law and justice, veterinarian and the zoological sciences (in no particular order of importance). MAI aims to enable discourse between the various interests (from the arts, literature, feminist studies, queer studies, philosophy, law and public policy, to the humanities and cultural studies, to name just a few) within this rapidly developing transdisciplinary field in ways that will improve the status of nonhuman animals and alleviate nonhuman animal exploitation. As such, MAI also facilitates research in Animal Studies. So we will soon be calling for abstracts from all these areas of interest. That said, MAC4, like all past conferences, will have dedicated themes that may help you focus your presentation. Our six themes and some possible topics for your consideration are outlined below. We stress to all delegates that they should participate in Minding Animals Conferences in a spirit of honesty and cooperation, accepting that other delegates may have divergent opinions, but always with the overall objective of protecting animals, no matter in what form or time frame. Nonetheless, we urge critical debate and active engagement with your fellow delegates.
